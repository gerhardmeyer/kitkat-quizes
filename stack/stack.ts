// Create a class called "Stack" that contains a private array called "items".
// The stack must be constrcuted with a specific type, but it supports any type.
// The class must have the following methods:
// - push(item: T): void - adds an item to the top of the stack
// - pop(): T | undefined - removes and returns the item from the top of the stack
